# kickstArrt

A public-IP media stack run through Docker on a VPS, with a single GitHub repo as the source
of truth for compose files, configs that live in code, and all setup/ops documentation. This
It uses direct Traefik `:443` ingress (Cloudflare is DNS-only) and is designed for CPU-only VPS
hosts.

```

Media flow: Prowlarr finds releases (incl. the Torrentio debrid indexer) → Sonarr/Radarr grab
them → Decypharr resolves them into instant files on a FUSE mount → the \*arrs symlink them
into the library → Jellyfin streams to any client; Seerr handles user requests.

## The access model

The one fact to hold onto throughout setup, stated once here: the box answers the public
internet from **exactly one serving port — `443` (Traefik)**, plus `80` as a pure
`http → https` redirect, and both are opened deliberately as the
[last setup step](quickstart#12-go-public-last). **Everything else is tailnet-only**: sshd,
the DNS resolver, and all the admin panels, reached by name via [Tailnet DNS](tailnet). The
whole setup runs inside that private window — the reasoning behind these choices is
collected in the [FAQ](faq).

**HTTPS comes out of the box.** Traefik's ACME provider issues a **Let's Encrypt wildcard
certificate for `*.DOMAIN`** via the Cloudflare DNS-01 challenge (`CLOUDFLARE_DNS_TOKEN`),
renewed automatically — every service's UI ships on HTTPS from the public internet the moment
you point its [A record](ingress) at the VPS, and on the tailnet before that. No per-app TLS
configuration is involved.

## VPS sizing

A streaming-only setup like this doesn't need much. **2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM** handles a small
house; **4 vCPU / 8 GB** is comfortable if Jellyfin has to transcode to clients. The stack
streams from debrid and never stores a media library on the host, so disk is just the OS +
config — 10–20 GB is plenty (container images plus a bit of headroom).

There is **no GPU passthrough here** — VPS hosts are CPU-only, so Jellyfin transcodes in
software. Keep your library direct-play friendly (same codec/container as your clients) and
you'll rarely transcode at all ([FAQ](faq#why-does-jellyfin-transcode-in-software-no-gpu)).

## Operating system

**Debian** (stable) is the safe default — minimal, long support cycles, and every Docker
guide assumes it. Most providers offer a Debian 12 image out of the box; Oracle Cloud
doesn't, so use **Ubuntu 26.04 Minimal** there instead. The full Oracle walkthrough is the
[OCI appendix](oci).

All absolute host paths in this wiki are written as the compose env vars they map to —
`$CONFIG_DIR` (app configs) is the repo's own `data/` dir, written into
`stacks/traefik/.env` and `stacks/media-server/.env` by `just init`. Media is served from
the debrid FUSE mount, so there is no local media directory to configure.
