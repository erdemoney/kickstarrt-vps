# Maintenance and day-to-day ops

## Ops recipes (`justfile`)

| Command                         | What it does                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `just init`                     | create/reconcile `.env` files and fill interactive secrets (idempotent)           |
| `just up`                       | create networks, config dirs, `acme.json`, then bring up every stack |
| `just down`                     | tear every stack down                                                             |
| `just update-all`               | pull fresh images + recreate changed containers                                   |
| `just update <svc>`             | pull + recreate one service, searched across all stacks, e.g. `just update jellyfin` |
| `just maintenance-run`          | fast-forward Git, update all stacks, then run the health checks                   |
| `just maintenance-schedule`     | install the overnight maintenance timer (default: 03:00 local time)              |
| `just maintenance-status`       | show the next maintenance run                                                     |
| `just maintenance-unschedule`   | stop and remove the maintenance timer                                             |
| `just health`                   | read-only host, firewall, DNS, and container health panel                         |
| `just logs <stack>`             | tail logs for a stack                                                             |
| `just logs-svc <svc>`           | tail logs for one service, e.g. `just logs-svc jellyfin` (found across all stacks) |
| `just restart <stack>`          | restart a stack                                                                   |
| `just validate`                 | `docker compose config -q` on every stack (read-only — never writes a `.env`)     |
| `just prepare`                  | create config dirs and `acme.json` (0600) (called by `just up`) |
| `just add-indexers`             | install all custom Prowlarr indexer definitions (Torrentio, TorBox, comet, …; see [Indexers](indexers)) |
| `just wire`                     | interactively reconcile Arr/Decypharr/Prowlarr/Bazarr links and Recyclarr secrets through REST APIs; use `--dry-run` to preview |
| `just dns`                      | print the tailnet DNS resolver setup (see [Tailnet DNS](tailnet))                 |
| `just networks`                 | create the shared `internal` network (pinned subnet `172.30.0.0/16`)                   |
| `just lockdown`                 | apply or re-apply the UFW lockdown and Docker forwarding gate; verifies both and refuses unless the box is on the tailnet |
| `just public enable <svc>` / `just public disable <svc>` | enable or remove a service's public Traefik router; does not change UFW or DNS |
| `just public status`            | show which services are tailnet-only or also routed publicly     |
| `just go-public` / `just go-public close` | open / close the public serving ports `443`/`80` (see [Quickstart §12](quickstart#12-go-public-last)) |
| `sudo ufw-docker check`         | verify the Docker forward gate (installed by `just lockdown`; see [Hardening](hardening)) |
| `just backup-init`              | create the restic repository in `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` (idempotent; see below)       |
| `just backup` / `backup-list` / `backup-check` / `backup-prune` / `backup-restore` | restic snapshots, integrity, retention, restore — see below |

Formatting and linting are handled by **pre-commit** directly (`pre-commit install` once, then
hooks run automatically on every commit). The hooks cover YAML/JSON syntax and formatting,
large files, merge markers, case conflicts, private keys and staged-secret scanning; CI runs
the same set plus a full-history secret scan. Gitleaks is auto-downloaded by pre-commit on
first run.

The update flow the repo is built around: Renovate opens a PR → CI and review → merge → the
overnight maintenance timer runs `git pull --ff-only`, `just update-all`, and a deployment health
check (see [Updates](updates)). `just maintenance-run` runs the same flow immediately.

### Scheduled maintenance

The optional systemd timer applies merged Renovate updates during a quiet window. Install it with
the default schedule of 03:00 in the server's local timezone:

```
just maintenance-schedule
```

Choose another systemd calendar expression when needed:

```
just maintenance-schedule "*-*-* 04:30:00"
just maintenance-status
```

Each run requires a clean Git worktree, uses `git pull --ff-only`, updates the stacks, and verifies
Docker plus every expected container. A lock prevents an unattended run from overlapping a manual
`just maintenance-run`. The timer does not catch up missed runs after downtime, avoiding an
unexpected daytime deployment. Output is available with:

```
journalctl -u kickstarrt-maintenance.service
```

Remove the timer with `just maintenance-unschedule`. If a run fails, inspect the journal and run
`just maintenance-run` manually after resolving the issue; this first version deliberately does
not attempt an automatic rollback.

## Backups

This is a pure-debrid stack — the host holds nothing but config, so the whole backup story is
one target: the **config directory** (everything under `$CONFIG_DIR` — `acme.json`, the
Traefik configs, and each app's own state like the \*arr databases). Nothing in compose is
precious — any container is one `just up` from a clean slate. The config directory is the
only state you can't rebuild; if you snapshot exactly one thing, snapshot that (provider
snapshot API, a cron'd rsync to another disk, ...).

### Offsite restic backups of the repo

Local snapshots cover the config state; the other state that can't be rebuilt from `main` is
the **repo working tree itself** — `stacks/*/.env` hold every secret and `data/` holds
runtime config. Back it up too, encrypted and deduplicated, with
[restic](https://restic.net), run in a container by `just` (nothing to install). One-time
setup:

```
just init          # answer yes to the R2 restic step (or copy .env.restic.example -> .env.restic by hand)
just backup-init   # create the restic repository (idempotent)
just backup        # snapshot the repo; schedule it daily via a systemd timer or cron
```

`.env.restic` is passed to the container with `docker run --env-file`. `just init` configures
it for the documented backend, **Cloudflare R2** — zero egress, no minimums, same account as
the rest of this stack. (Backblaze B2 is cheaper raw storage; every backend works, but you're
on your own if you deviate — see below.)

#### Cloudflare R2 (the documented path)

1. Open [Cloudflare R2](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/overview) → **Create bucket** (e.g. `media-server-restic`; location
   Automatic).
2. **R2** → [**Manage R2 API Tokens**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/api-tokens)
   → **Create API token** → type **User API Token**, permission **Object → Read & Write**
   (Admin is more than restic needs; read-only breaks `just backup-prune`). Save the
   **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**, and note your **Account ID** (R2 page, scroll
   down: **Usage → Account Details**).
3. Run `just init` and answer **yes** to "Configure Cloudflare R2 restic backups now?" — it
   prompts for the Account ID, bucket, access key, secret key, and encryption password, then
   writes `.env.restic`:

   ```
   RESTIC_REPOSITORY=s3:https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/<BUCKET>
   RESTIC_PASSWORD=...
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
   AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=auto
   ```

   `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` must stay `auto` — it's R2's only region. To configure by hand
   instead of re-running init, copy `.env.restic.example` to `.env.restic` and fill the same
   values.

#### Other backends (on you)

Any backend restic reaches over the network works with these recipes unchanged — set
`RESTIC_REPOSITORY` and the matching credentials yourself. (A `local dir`, `sftp:` or
`rclone:` repository additionally needs its path, key or config mounted into the restic
container, which the recipes don't do.)

| Backend       | `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` example               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Backblaze B2  | `b2:my-bucket:my-path` (cheapest storage) |
| local dir     | `/mnt/backups/restic`                     |
| SFTP          | `sftp:user@host:/srv/restic`              |
| S3-compatible | `s3:s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket`           |
| Azure / GCS   | `azure:container:/path` / `gs:bucket:/path` |
| rclone        | `rclone:remote:path`                      |

Credential vars live in `.env.restic` too (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
`B2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `B2_ACCOUNT_KEY`, `RCLONE_CONFIG`, ...) and are forwarded the same way.
Snapshots take the whole working tree — including `.git`, `.env.restic`, and every ignored file. Keep
`RESTIC_PASSWORD` somewhere safe separately: without it the repository is unrecoverable.

Other recipes:

| Command                     | What it does                                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `just backup-list`          | list snapshots                                             |
| `just backup-check`         | verify repository integrity (for a full audit run `restic check --read-data` manually) |
| `just backup-prune`         | `forget --prune` honoring `RESTIC_KEEP_*` in `.env.restic` |
| `just backup-restore [<id>]`| dry-run preview, then restore into the repo working tree (default: latest) |
| `just backup-schedule [<cal>]`| install a systemd timer running `just backup` then `just backup-prune` (default `daily`; sudo) |
| `just backup-unschedule`    | stop and remove the installed systemd timer (sudo)         |

Schedule the routine snapshots with a **systemd timer** — better than cron here: journald
captures the output, and `Persistent=true` catches up on a backup that was skipped while the
host was off. (`just backup` alone still snapshots without pruning; use `just backup-prune`
by hand, or let the timer do both.)

```bash
just backup-schedule                     # runs daily
just backup-schedule "*-*-* 04:30:00"    # custom calendar, re-run to change
```

This writes `kickstarrt-restic-backup.{service,timer}` under `/etc/systemd/system` via sudo
(with a confirmation prompt), resolves your actual `just` path into `ExecStart`, and enables
the timer. Each run **backs up, then prunes**: `backup-prune` runs only after a successful
backup, so snapshots are retained per `RESTIC_KEEP_*` and pruned automatically — no need to
SSH in to keep storage bounded. On a host **without** systemd (Alpine, OpenWrt, a NAS
scheduler), it prints the equivalent cron line and exits non-zero — or use cron directly:

```
0 4 * * * cd /srv/kickstarrt && /usr/local/bin/just backup && /usr/local/bin/just backup-prune
```

`systemctl list-timers kickstarrt-restic-backup.timer` shows the next run;
`just backup-unschedule` removes the units.

`just backup-restore` is **non-destructive**: it dry-runs first, prints exactly what would be
restored/updated, and asks for confirmation before writing anything. Files present locally
but missing from the snapshot are kept (no `--delete`); restored files overwrite current ones
in place. It re-creates the repo working tree (`data/` + all `.env` files); `.env.restic`
survives restores. Drill a restore into a scratch clone periodically — an untested backup is
a gamble. Note the offsite-repo point: `$CONFIG_DIR` is the repo's own `data/` dir, so a
restic snapshot already covers everything this host can't rebuild; the R2 repository exists
for the case local snapshots can't help — the box itself disappearing.

> **`data/` is untracked app state.** Never `git clean` on the server — `-dfx` removes
> ignored files, i.e. the whole config state. `git pull`/`reset --hard` are safe (they only
> touch tracked files). And keep the working tree clean (no uncommitted changes) before
> `just backup-restore`, otherwise restored versions of the tracked `data/traefik/*.yml`
> show up as diffs.

## Troubleshooting

| New indexer/app link fails                   | check the URL+port against the [internal DNS table](arrs); revisit the API key |
| Direct Play / Direct Play (Anime) profile missing in Radarr/Sonarr | `docker logs recyclarr`; if an arr's API key was regenerated, run `just wire` |
| Bouncer not blocking                         | recreate crowdsec + traefik after a key change; `cscli bouncers list`          |
| Traefik won't start after this repo's change | first start downloads plugins — check outbound internet; `just validate` first |
| Something in one container only              | `just update <svc>` after a tag bump, don't `down` the stack                   |
