# FAQ

The design decisions behind the stack, collected out of the action path. For how-to, follow
the page each answer links to.

## Why can't I proxy media through Cloudflare?

Proxy status on a hostname must be **DNS only** (grey cloud). Cloudflare's
[Service-Specific Terms](https://www.cloudflare.com/service-specific-terms-application-services/)
say that unless you're an Enterprise customer, you must use their paid services (Stream,
Images, R2) "in order to serve video and other large files via the CDN" — and Cloudflare
reserves the right to disable or limit the CDN when it suspects otherwise. Video streamed
from your own origin through the free edge isn't covered by an exception, whether or not
caching is disabled, and a Cloudflare Tunnel routes traffic through that same edge.

So this stack moves **no video through Cloudflare's network**: public hostnames are DNS-only
A records straight to the VPS, and Cloudflare only answers recursive DNS lookups and the ACME
`_acme-challenge` TXT record. That is unreservedly compliant — and since the box has a static
public IP, there's nothing to hide anyway. Details: [Ingress](ingress).

## Why no Cloudflare Tunnel?

A tunnel's main trick is hiding the origin IP — worthless on a box that owns a static public
IP and serves DNS-only records anyway. What a tunnel would add, the box already has
equivalents for: the WAF story is [CrowdSec](security) inside Traefik, and Cloudflare Access
(SSO in front of apps) would break Jellyfin's TV and mobile clients — they authenticate with
a device token, not a browser. Serving `:443` directly keeps out one more moving part and one
more third-party hop.

## Why is there no Let's Encrypt account to create?

Let's Encrypt has no signup, dashboard, or email verification. Traefik registers an ACME
account on first start and stores it in `$CONFIG_DIR/traefik/acme.json`; the cert is issued
via the **DNS-01** challenge (Traefik creates and deletes `_acme-challenge` TXT records
through Cloudflare), which is why the wildcard exists before any DNS record points at the box
and no inbound port is needed. `ACME_EMAIL` is just the contact address on the account — it
must be on a domain you control (their API rejects reserved ones like `@example.com`), it
doesn't receive mail, and since June 2025 Let's Encrypt doesn't even store it.

## Why do the admin panels have no public DNS records?

Radarr, Sonarr, Prowlarr and friends are admin tools — the only people who need them are you,
and you're on the [tailnet](tailnet), where they resolve by name with the real wildcard cert
and no extra login: **being on the tailnet is the gate**. That's one fewer public,
brute-forceable login surface per app.

Honest caveat: Traefik is reachable on the box's *public* IP (that's the point of going
public), so a determined client can connect there and send a panel's `Host:` header. It
lands on the public entrypoint, which has **no router for panels** — a 404, not the app.
Only the tailnet bind serves panels ([Ingress](ingress#the-security-gate)); every panel
also keeps its own auth layered on top.

## Why is everything closed until "going public"?

A fresh VPS is scanned within minutes of booting, and an app that's live on the internet
before its first-run setup is an app with no login — claimable by anyone. So the whole setup
runs privately over the tailnet, and `:443` opens only after every app has auth on, as the
deliberate last step ([Quickstart §12](quickstart#12-go-public-last)). One serving port,
opened once, reversible with a single ufw command.

## Why does Jellyfin transcode in software (no GPU)?

VPS hosts are CPU-only — there's no `/dev/dri` to pass through. In practice, debrid streams
arrive in client-friendly codecs and direct-play covers nearly everything (sizing guidance in
the [overview](index)); transcoding is the exception, and a 2–4 vCPU box handles it when it
happens. The stack leans into this: the shipped
[Direct Play and Direct Play (Anime) quality profiles](arrs#quality-profiles-recyclarr--automatic) score
anything that would force a video transcode out of the grab candidates entirely.

## Why Ubuntu on Oracle Cloud but Debian elsewhere?

Debian stable is the safe default — minimal, long support cycles, and most providers ship a
Debian image. Oracle's catalog doesn't offer one, so the [OCI guide](oci) uses **Ubuntu 26.04
Minimal**.

## Why does CrowdSec fail open?

If the CrowdSec LAPI is unreachable, the edge lets traffic through rather than blocking
everything — a security-agent outage shouldn't take the whole stack down. The window is
seconds (the first stream sync after Traefik boot), and the toggles live in
[Security](security).
