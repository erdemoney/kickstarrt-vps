# prerequisites.sh - one-shot bootstrap for a fresh VPS (see docs/quickstart.md).
#
# Installs, idempotently: Tailscale, git, just, Docker (with the compose
# plugin), ufw, and adds the invoking user to the `docker` group. Only needs
# curl. Cross-distro: Debian/Ubuntu (apt), Fedora/RHEL (dnf/yum), openSUSE
# (zypper), Arch (pacman) and Alpine (apk).
#
#     curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erdemoney/kickstarrt-vps/main/scripts/prerequisites.sh | sudo bash
#
# At the end the script joins the box to your tailnet: it prints the auth URL
# and waits up to 120s for you to approve it, then prints the box's tailnet
# address - your only SSH address. Approval is always yours; if the window
# passes, it falls back to printing the manual `sudo tailscale up` step.
#
# It deliberately does NOT touch the firewall rules. Closing the public door is
# a lockdown you do consciously, with `just firewall` (Quickstart §5): it
# refuses to run unless the box is on the tailnet, prints what it's about to
# do, and asks for confirmation before ufw drops the public IP route. ufw is
# only *installed* here; nothing is enabled, so a fresh box can never be locked
# out by this script alone.
